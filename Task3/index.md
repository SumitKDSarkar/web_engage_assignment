**My approch to solve this issue is to:**

1. **Approach to Task 1 (Low-Priority Customer):**

Given that Task 1 is for a low-priority customer who hasn't provided a specific go-live date, I would prioritize Task 2 due to its time sensitivity. My approach to Task 1 would be to send an extension request to the customer explaining the situation and requesting an additional 3 days to complete the task. This way, I can manage the urgent Task 2 while waiting for Task 1's approval. If Task 1 gets delayed, it is less critical than Task 2, which needs immediate attention.

2. **Approach to Task 2 (Priority Customer):**

Task 2 is for a priority customer with a campaign that needs to go live in the next 2 days. I would prioritize this task and ensure that it is completed on time. I would allocate my resources and efforts to meet this deadline, even in the event of a family emergency.

3. **Communication with Account Managers:**

(i) For task1 (Low-Priority Customer, Manoj is the Account Manager):

Dear Manoj,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you of an urgent matter that has arisen. Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, I won't be able to meet the original due date for Task 1, which is scheduled for tomorrow.

As Task 1 pertains to a low-priority customer who hasn't provided a specific go-live date, I believe it would be in the best interest of both parties to request a brief extension for this task. This extension will ensure we can deliver the best quality work once I'm back on track.

I will promptly send an email to the customer explaining the situation and requesting their understanding in granting us a short extension. I will keep you updated on their response and the new proposed timeline for Task 1.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this challenging time.

Best regards,
Sumit Kumar Dey Sarkar.

(ii) For Task 2 (Priority Customer, Ravi is the Account Manager):

Dear Ravi,

I want to inform you that I am prioritizing Task 2, which is for our priority customer and has a go-live date in the next 2 days. Despite a family emergency, I am committed to meeting this deadline and ensuring a smooth campaign launch. I will keep you updated on the progress and handle Task 1 with the low-priority customer separately. If you have any specific requirements or updates regarding Task 2, please feel free to reach out.
Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Sumit Kumar Dey Sarkar.

4) **Communication with the Customer (Delay Notification Email):**

For the low-priority customer in Task 1, I would send an email to inform them about the delay and the extension request:

Subject: Update on Task 1 - Extension Request

"Dear sir,

I hope this message finds you well. I want to inform you that due to unforeseen circumstances, we may require a slight extension for Task 1, which was initially scheduled for completion tomorrow.

We understand the importance of your project and remain committed to delivering high-quality results. To ensure that we can meet your expectations effectively, we kindly request an extension of 3 additional days. This will allow us to allocate the necessary resources and attention to your project.

If you have any concerns or questions regarding this extension, please do not hesitate to reach out. Your satisfaction is our top priority.
